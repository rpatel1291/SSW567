# Week 1
## Objective

Think back to your elementary school geometry class where you learned about scalene, isosceles, equilateral, and right triangles.  Recall that:

    equilateral triangles have all three sides with the same length
    isosceles triangles have two sides with the same length
    scalene triangles have three sides with different lengths
    right triangles have three sides with lengths, a, b, and c where a2 + b2 = c2

Your assignment is to write a program in Python to classify triangles and use an automated test platform, e.g. UnitTest or PyTest, and write test cases to test your implementation of classifying triangles.  The goal is for you to gain experience using automated test tools and to think through the issues associated with testing a "system".
